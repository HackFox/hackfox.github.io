## `DISPLAY DLLS`, `LIST DLLS`

These two commands show the dynamic link library calls that have been declared in the current sessions.

### Usage

```foxpro
DISPLAY DLLS [TO [ FILE ] Filename [ ADDITIVE ]
              | TO PRINTER [PROMPT]]
             [ NOCONSOLE ]
LIST DLLS    [TO [ FILE ] Filename [ADDITIVE ]
              | TO PRINTER [PROMPT]]
             [ NOCONSOLE ]
```

These commands are typically used during development and debugging to determine if DLL functions have been declared. They probably aren't things you'd want to leave around in a program. If you need to test whether a function has been declared in a program, prior to VFP 7, your best bet was to test TYPE("MyDLLFunctionCall(param, param, param)"), but realize that this test actually calls and runs the function. You wouldn't want to do this with any function that causes undesirable side effects, like shutting down Windows. Since issuing the DECLARE function again does not seem to cause any harm, we prefer to do that than to risk unintentional side effects with this trick. `ADLLS()` was added in VFP 7 to fill an array with a list of DLL functions that have been loaded, making life easier if you need to know what functions have been declared.

Each DLL is listed with its name, alias (if assigned), and the path of the target DLL.

### Example

```foxpro
LIST DLLS TO PRINT PROMPT NOCONSOLE
DISPLAY DLLS
```
