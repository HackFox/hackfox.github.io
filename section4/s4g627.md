## Sizable

Sizable allows you to resize a toolbar, OLEBoundControl, or OLEControl.

### Usage

```foxpro
oObject.Sizable = lResizable
lResizable = oObject.Sizable
```

When Sizable is set true, a toolbar can be resized by clicking and dragging the mouse over any of its borders.

<table>
<tr>
  <td width="17%" valign="top">
<img width="95" height="78" src="bug.gif">
  </td>
  <td width="83%">
  <p>Even if a toolbar's Sizable property is .F., the mouse pointer still displays double-headed arrows when floated over the borders. Even more difficult to deal with is that, while the user cannot reshape a toolbar, docking (particularly docking on the vertical edges) reshapes the toolbar. Since this is bound to frustrate your users to no end, we recommend you leave this as the default .T.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

For an OLE object, Sizable determines whether the object within the control can be resized. When the object is activated, by double-clicking or using the DoVerb method, the border around the object shows drag handles on the corners and centers of each border. A user can then resize an OLE object to obscure other controls on the form, but only until the control loses the focus&mdash;then the OLE object is cropped to fit within its original size. Similarly, shrinking the OLE object does not change the active, clickable area of the OLE control. However, if AutoSize is also true, the entire control resizes to accommodate the resized OLE object. We can't imagine a situation where we would want the end user to have that much control. Sizable is a good feature, but not when it's combined with AutoSize.

### Example

```foxpro
oForm.OLEControl.Sizable = .T.
```
