## Cdx(), Mdx(), Ndx()

These functions give you the names of index files. CDX() and MDX() are identical. Both return the name of a compound index file; MDX() is included only for compatibility with dBASE. NDX() returns the name of a stand-alone index file.

### Usage

```foxpro
cIndexFile = CDX( nWhichIndex [, nWorkArea | cAlias] )
cIndexFile = MDX( nWhichIndex [, nWorkArea | cAlias] )
cIndexFile = NDX( nWhichIndex [, nWorkArea | cAlias] )
```

When multiple index files are opened for a table, they're assigned positions based on the order in which they're specified. For example, if you:

```foxpro
USE MyTable INDEX AnIndex, AnotherIndex
```
AnIndex is index 1 and AnotherIndex is index 2. The parameter nWhichIndex is based on this ordering. For CDX() and MDX(), a structural index file is always index 1, if it exists. Any CDX files explicitly opened come after the structural index.

We don't use these functions often, but when we do, it's usually CDX() and it's because some of the other index functions (like TAGNO() and TAGCOUNT()) need the name of the index file when you pass them an alias. 

These functions have one very friendly behavior. If you pass a value for nWhichIndex larger than the number of index files of that type that are open, they return the empty string. This makes these functions ideal for writing code to find all the open indexes.

### Example

```foxpro
* create an array containing all CDX files for current work area
LOCAL cCDX, nCDXCnt

DIMENSION aCDX[1]
aCDX[1]=""

nCDXCnt=1
DO WHILE NOT EMPTY(CDX(nCDXCnt))
   DIMENSION aCDX[nCDXCnt]
   aCDX[nCDXCnt]=CDX(nCDXCnt)
   nCDXCnt=nCDXCnt+1
ENDDO

* get the name of the third open stand-alone index file
* for MyOldTable
? NDX(3, "MyOldTable")
```

All three functions respect the current setting of SET FULLPATH. With SET FULLPATH ON, they return a fully qualified file name; when SET FULLPATH is OFF, they return only the drive and index name.

As with other functions that let you pass an alias or work area number, we strongly recommend you don't use work area numbers. Always refer to tables by their aliases.
