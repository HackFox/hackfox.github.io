## `CLOSE ALL`

`CLOSE ALL` is a kitchen sink command. It closes databases, tables and their indexes, and any files opened via the `Low-level File Functions`. It also closes certain system windows, but not user-defined windows. It closes alternate files, format files, procedure files and class libraries. Basically, it does everything the individual CLOSE commands do, plus a little more.
