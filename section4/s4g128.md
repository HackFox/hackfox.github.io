## `SET BLINK`, `SET INTENSITY`, Set("Blink"), Set("Intensity")

Two settings for the DOS screen, supported but ignored in Visual FoxPro, with one small exception.

### Usage

```foxpro
SET BLINK ON | OFF
SET INTENSITY ON | OFF
cBlinkOnorOff = SET( "BLINK" )
cIntenseOnorOff = SET( "INTENSITY" )
```

`SET BLINK` is a setting for the DOS VGA and EGA screen modes that support blinking. Blinking is unsupported in Windows as an interface standard, and ignored in Visual FoxPro. We miss the easy-to-code "Please Wait..." messages we could get with `SET BLINK`.

`SET INTENSITY` was the flip side of the same DOS coin&mdash;if blinking were turned off, manipulating the intensity of some objects would give you twice the colors of the standard 16-color palette, a feature we used to our advantage in some FoxPro DOS screens. It would make sense that this functionality would also be ignored in Visual FoxPro, and it is, with one small exception. 

`SET INTENSITY` ON, the default, sets the background color of explicitly issued @ ... GET commands to the color Windows has set for its button faces. If INTENSITY is set OFF, the background of the GET is transparent.
