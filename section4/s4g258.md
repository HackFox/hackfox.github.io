## `RESTORE WINDOW`, `SAVE WINDOW`

One of the mutant branches of the Xbase evolution toward windows management that died a fitting death along the way. Retained in Visual FoxPro for "backward compatibility."

### Usage

```foxpro
RESTORE WINDOW Window1 [,Window2 [, ... ] ] | ALL
        FROM MEMO MemoField | FileName
SAVE WINDOW Window1 [,Window2 [, ... ] ] | ALL
        TO MEMO MemoField | FileName
```

These commands let you save and restore a series of window definitions to either a file or a memo field. The definitions are stored in incomprehensible, undocumentable (and undocumented) binary format. The filename has a WIN extension, unless a different extension is specified. Although we could see the advantage of this method in order to allow users to customize their environment to meet their needs, we have never actually seen this method succeed in an application. With the fine control available in form events such as Resize and Move, we feel that custom methods to save and restore the Top, Left, Height and Width properties have far more chance of succeeding than the use of these commands.

### Example

```foxpro
SAVE WINDOW Form1 to Form1
RESTORE WINDOW Form1 FROM Form1
```
