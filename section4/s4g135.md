## `SET DELIMITERS`, `SET READBORDER`, Set("Delimiters"), Set("ReadBorder")

These two commands relate to old ways of indicating the bounds of a text box. They're pretty much irrelevant in Visual FoxPro. 

### Usage

```foxpro
SET DELIMITERS ON | OFF
SET DELIMITERS TO cDelimiters | TO DEFAULT
cOnOrOff = SET( "DELIMITERS" )
cDelimiters = SET( "DELIMITERS", 1 )
SET READBORDER ON | OFF
cOnOrOff = SET( "READBORDER" )
```

`SET DELIMITERS` goes back to the very early days of Xbase. It allows you to put either colons or a pair of characters of your choice at either end of a text box (or its predecessor, the @ .. GET). It was handy in the days when you had neither color differences nor border lines to distinguish the endpoints. Although it sort of works in Visual FoxPro, there's no reason to use delimiters&mdash;just specify BorderStyle = 1 to put a nice border around a text box.

`SET READBORDER` applies only to @ .. GETs and serves the same purpose as BorderStyle, except that it applies to all the @ .. GETs within a screen. Like most SET commands, we think it can be far more trouble than it's worth, and recommend you stay away from it.
