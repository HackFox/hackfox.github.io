## ASelObj()

ASELOBJ() tells you which objects are selected in the Form or Class Designer. With these references, you can determine and/or change an object's properties. In addition, ASELOBJ() allows you to reach "through" an object to determine the object's container or the containing form's data environment. 

### Usage

```foxpro
nSelCount = ASelObj( ArrayName [, nContainer ] )
```
<table>
<tr>
  <td width="32%" valign="top">
  <p><b>Parameter</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width="23%" valign="top">
  <p><b>Value</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width="45%" valign="top">
  <p><b>Meaning</b></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width="32%" valign="top">
  <p>ArrayName</p>
  </td>
  <td width="23%" valign="top">
  <p>Name</p>
  </td>
  <td width="45%" valign="top">
  <p>The array to contain the object references.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width="32%" rowspan="3" valign="top">
  <p>nContainer</p>
  </td>
  <td width="23%" valign="top">
  <p>Omitted</p>
  </td>
  <td width="45%" valign="top">
  <p>Get a reference to each selected object.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width="33%" valign="top">
  <p>1</p>
  </td>
  <td width="67%" valign="top">
  <p>Get a reference to the containing object of the selected objects.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width="33%" valign="top">
  <p>2</p>
  </td>
  <td width="67%" valign="top">
  <p>Get a reference to the data environment of the form.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width="32%" rowspan="2" valign="top">
  <p>nSelCount</p>
  </td>
  <td width="23%" valign="top">
  <p>Positive number</p>
  </td>
  <td width="45%" valign="top">
  <p>The number of elements in the array, which is the number of selected objects (or 1 for a container or data environment).</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width="33%" valign="top">
  <p>0</p>
  </td>
  <td width="67%" valign="top">
  <p>No objects were selected, or in the case of nContainer = 2, the object(s) selected is not on a form. The array is not created in this case.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

ASELOBJ() is a key to writing Builders. It lets you determine what control or controls are selected when the user runs a Builder. The object references in the array let you modify the properties and methods of the selected objects based on user input.

SYS(1270) is a first cousin to ASELOBJ(). It returns a reference to the object currently under the mouse and doesn't require that the object be selected.

### Example

```foxpro
* Before typing the code below in the Command Window,
* open the Form Designer and place a few labels on the form.
* Select at least three labels.
= ASelObj(aObjects)
aObjects[1].Caption = "First Label"
aObjects[2].Caption = "Second Label"
aObjects[3].BackColor = RGB(255,0,255)
aObjects[3].ForeColor = RGB(0,255,0)
```

In a Builder, you can make this sort of change in code based on user input. With references to the form and data environment, you can make changes to those as well&mdash;for example, resizing the form to fit the controls it contains.
