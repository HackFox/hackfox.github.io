## `FDATE()`, `FTIME()`

These functions return the date and time a file was last updated, according to the operating system.

### Usage

```foxpro
dLastDate = FDATE( cFileName )
cLastTime = FTIME( cFileName )
```

cFileName may include a path. If not, FoxPro looks first in the default directory, then along the FoxPro path.

### Example

```foxpro
? FDATE("WinWord.EXE")  && Returns 7/11/97 for Word 97 SR-1
? FTIME("WinWord.EXE")  && Returns 12:00:00 AM for Word 97 SR-1
```

Now that we have DateTime data, it would be nice to return the file date and time as a single string. On the other hand, adding FDateTime() to the language would be another case of unnecessary dBloat. It's easy enough to write your own using the conversion shown under `CTOT()`. Or you could just use `ADIR()`, which not only returns both date and time, but is well-behaved if the file doesn't exist.
