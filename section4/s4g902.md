## `Quit Method`

This method shuts down the VFP application server.

### Usage

```foxpro
_VFP.Quit()
Application.Quit()
oVFPObject.Quit()
```

You can address Visual FoxPro as an Automation server. When you do so, the `Quit Method` lets you close the server. It's the Automation equivalent to the Quit command.

As the syntax diagram shows, you can also use Quit with the _VFP and Application references to the currently executing VFP session. Of course, doing so abruptly ends that session.

Unlike the Quit methods of some other Automation servers, VFP's `Quit Method` doesn't provide a way for you to indicate what should happen to unsaved changes. So, issuing the `Quit Method` when files are open for editing (in the development environment) generates a series of "Do you want to save changes ..." dialogs.

Calling this method fires any `ON SHUTDOWN` routine. If you're trying to do something totally behind the scenes, make sure that the `ON SHUTDOWN` routine doesn't call for user interaction.

Quit isn't available to your custom Automation servers because you normally would not want to expose the `Application Object`. Create your own custom Quit routine if you need one as part of your server.

### Example

```foxpro
oVFP = CreateObject("VisualFoxPro.Application")
oVFP.Quit()
```
