## `LEN()`

This function tells you how long a string is. 

### Usage

```foxpro
nStringLength = LEN( cString )
```

That's it, just the length of the string you pass it. 

Except for one thing. There's a gotcha when you use `LEN()` on a character field (it works fine on memo fields). Fields in FoxPro are fixed-length, so strings that don't fill the allocated space get filled with trailing blanks. When you apply `LEN()` to a character field, you get back the defined size of the field, not the size of the actual contents. Apply `TRIM()` or `ALLTRIM()` before `LEN()` if you want to know how many characters you've actually put in a field.

Like most of the string-handling functions, `LEN()` has a double-byte alternative, `LENC()`, useful for handling strings in languages that have larger character sets.

### Example

```foxpro
? LEN("abcdef")      && returns 6
? LEN(LastName)      && returns defined length of LastName field
? LEN(TRIM(LastName)) && returns length of LastName for
                      && current record
```
