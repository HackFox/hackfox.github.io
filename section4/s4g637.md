## `SET FULLPATH`, Set("FullPath")

This setting determines whether a few functions return a complete path with their results or only the drive and file name. The function returns the current setting.

### Usage

```foxpro
SET FULLPATH ON | OFF
cOnOrOff = SET( "FULLPATH" )
```

This setting affects the various functions that return file names for open tables and databases. In addition to the ones listed in Help (`DBF()`, `CDX()`, `MDX()` and `NDX()`), it also applies to `DBC()`.

We're mystified as to why anyone would ever want this turned off. What good does "F:CUSTOMER.DBF" do you? Guess you might parse the drive name off to get just the file name, but even that's no big deal anymore since `JUSTDRIVE()`'s been added to the language.

### Example

```foxpro
USE HOME()+"FoxUser" AGAIN
? DBF(1) && Returns something like G:\VFP 7\FOXUSER.DBF
SET FULLPATH OFF
? DBF(1) && Returns something like G:FOXUSER.DBF
```
