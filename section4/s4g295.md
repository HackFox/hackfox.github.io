## Set FDoW, Set FWeek, Set("FDoW"), Set("FWeek")

FDoW sets the first day of the week, used to calculate DoW() (day of week) and Week(). FWeek determines how to compute the first week of the year for the Week() function.

### Usage

```foxpro
SET FDOW TO [ nFirstDayOfWeek ]
nFirstDayOfWeek = SET( "FDOW" )
SET FWEEK TO [ nFirstWeek ]
nFirstWeek = SET( "FWEEK" )
```

These functions come in handy for calculations involving work scheduling. You'll want to ensure your application SETs these explicitly in code or the CONFIG.FPW file if you plan to do calculations on these dates, because many manufacturing firms use week numbers as a key part of planning and scheduling.

### Example

```foxpro
SET FWEEK to 3  && First week is a full seven days
SET FDOW to 4   && Set the first day to Wednesday
```

The example above sets the first week of the year to the first week that falls entirely within the new year. FWEEK determines what day the week starts on from the setting of SET FDOW. Executing SET FWEEK overrides a setting previously set on the International tab of the Options screen, or the default read from the Registration Database. The Registry values are only read in the development version of VFP.
