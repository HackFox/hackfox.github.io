## `HOUR()`, `MINUTE()`, `SEC()`

These functions extract the hour, minute and second portions of a datetime value. Backward compatibility with previously existing functions makes for some funny, non-intuitive abbreviation rules.

### Usage

```foxpro
nHours = HOUR( tDateTime )
nMinute = MINUTE( tDateTime )
nSeconds = SEC( tDateTime )
```

`HOUR()` always returns the number of hours since midnight, regardless of the setting of SET HOUR. `MINUTE()` returns a numeric value from 0 to 59. No surprises here. `MINUTE()` may be abbreviated as short as Minu(), but realize that `MIN()` is the Minimum function, something completely different. Though confusing, it fits the general rule that you can abbreviate commands and functions to four characters or more. `SEC()` returns a numeric value from 0 to 59. In the opposite logic to `MINUTE()`, `SEC()` must be just the three characters&mdash;anything from Seco() up to `SECONDS()` causes Visual FoxPro to return the number of seconds since midnight, or squawk if a parameter is passed.

### Example

```foxpro
? "The time is now " + LTRIM(STR(HOUR(DATETIME()))) + ;
  " hours, " + LTRIM(STR(MINUTE(DATETIME()))) + ;
  " minutes and "  + LTRIM(STR(MINUTE(DATETIME()))) + ;
  " seconds past midnight"
```
