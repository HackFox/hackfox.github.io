## `CLEAR WINDOWS`

The last in the long list of Clear commands releases all user-defined windows from memory. It takes form windows as well as those defined with `DEFINE WINDOW`.

### Usage

```foxpro
CLEAR WINDOWS
```

When form windows are released with `CLEAR WINDOWS`, the variables that reference them are not released&mdash;instead, they become .NULL.
