## CursorToXML(), XMLToCursor()

As their names imply, these functions convert cursors to XML data and back. These functions were added in VFP 7.

### Usage

```foxpro
nBytesWritten = CursorToXML( nWorkArea | cAlias, cDestination
    [, nOutputFormat [, nFlags [, nRecords [, cSchemaName
    [, cSchemaLocation [, cNameSpace ] ] ] ] ] ] )
```

CursorToXML() takes a cursor and makes an XML string, either in a memory variable or written to a file. It has a lot of parameters that can lead to a lot of complexity. Fortunately, much of what you're likely to need to do doesn't have to be complex.

We could write a book on formatting an XML string, and how to use it. If you're serious about XML, you'll need more than a few pages, or even a chapter to understand it. We suggest you find a good book or Web site on XML to find out more about XML.

If you are working with code pages, you should refer to the updates in VFP's ReadMe.HTM file. Several last-minute changes were made regarding which code pages are supported.

  <p>Huh? A fixed bug in a function that just entered the language? Yep, the VFP team in Redmond was quick to bring us SP1 for VFP 7, which fixed a number of issues with the XML implementation, among other things. Specifically for CursorToXML(), two things were fixed. </p>
  <p>The first fix is when nFlags includes the value 8, which wraps memo fields in CDATA blocks. One would assume that no data translation would take place, meaning that the phrase &quot;&lt;attribute&gt;&quot; is not translated to &quot;&amp;gtattribute&amp;lt&quot;. VFP 7.0 improperly translates the data; SP1 fixes this error.</p>
  <p>The second fix is that in VFP 7.0, when the schema attribute is written, it is written as lsDataSet (a lower case &quot;L&quot; instead of an upper case &quot;I&quot;). SP1 fixes this problem. </p>

### Example

```foxpro
USE _SAMPLES + "data\customer.dbf" IN 0 SHARED
* Creates an element-centric file that preserves white space:
nBytes = CursorToXML("Customer", "Customer.xml", 1, 4+512)

* Creates a variable with an element-centric file.
x = CursorToXML("Customer", "cXMLstring", 1)
```
### Usage

```foxpro
nRecords = XMLToCursor( eXMLSource [ , cCursorName
           [ , nFlags ] ] )
```

XMLToCursor() has fewer parameters than its companion, CursorToXML(). It should have fewer; all the information needed to create a cursor is contained in the XML file!

In the initial shipping version of VFP 7, there was some disagreement within the FoxPro documentation as to exactly what the nFlag parameter values can be. The IntelliSense Quick Info feature shows values from 0&ndash;3. The Help file shows values of 4, 512, and 1024. (The ReadMe.HTM file also lists 2048 and 4096). The Help and the accompanying ReadMe.HTM files are correct. SP1 has a script to correct the FoxCode table; see the ReadMe file for more information. 

The FoxPro team is working hard to keep the XML features up-to-date as the various technologies move from technology previews into full-blown specifications. You'll want to keep abreast of the Hot Fixes and Service Patches available at the Microsoft Web site for updates to XML related functions.

<table>
<tr>
  <td width="17%" valign="top">
<img width="95" height="77" src="fixbug1.gif">
  </td>
  <td width="83%">
  <p>Here are terrific examples of why you want to keep up with the Hot Fixes and Service Patches. These items are fixed in SP1:</p>
  <p>Visual Studio writes out date/time data to XML files with fractional seconds and time zones&mdash;for example, 2002-10-05T00:00:00.0000000-07:00. VFP 7.0 cannot convert this, and therefore uses an empty date. SP1 reads this properly.</p>
  <p>VFP 7.0 crashes with a C0000005 error if a root attribute is not found. The root attribute is sometimes called &quot;&lt;root&gt;&quot;, but it can be called anything as long as there's a beginning tag after the declaration line (which also must be present) and a matching ending tag at the end of the document. (VFP's CursorToXML() function writes the root attribute as &quot;&lt;VFPData&gt;&quot;.) SP1 no longer crashes, but does properly fail if there is not a well-formed XML document.</p>
  <p>If there are large numbers of columns in the XML document, somewhere around the 150-column range, VFP 7.0 gets cranky. You either get a syntax error or a C0000005 fatal error, whichever VFP randomly selects. VFP 7 SP1 handles large numbers of columns properly.</p>
  <p>If the XML file has an inline schema, you get an extra record in VFP 7.0 (but it works fine if you use an external schema or no schema). SP1 fixes this, too.</p>
  <p>And finally, SP1 fixes a problem with reading XML from double-byte character systems. The length of the data field is half of what it should be (the number of characters, not the number of bytes needed to represent those characters). As a result, the data was truncated. It's fixed now.</p>
