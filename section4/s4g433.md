## `DISPLAY VIEWS`, `LIST VIEWS`

These two commands provide a list of views in the current database. Each shows the name of the view and whether it's local or remote. Views that have been taken offline also include a notation to that effect.

### Usage

```foxpro
DISPLAY | LIST VIEWS
        [ TO PRINTER [ PROMPT ]
          | TO [ FILE ] cFileName [ ADDITIVE ] ]
        [ NOCONSOLE ]
```

You can get the same information using a combination of ADBObject() and `DBGetProp()`.

A database needs to be open and current before issuing these commands.

### Example

```foxpro
OPEN DATA TasTrade
LIST VIEWS TO PRINTER
```
