## `CLEAR FIELDS`

This old command (he played one) combines `SET FIELDS` TO with `SET FIELDS` OFF, and applies it to all work areas. It's relevant only if you're using `SET FIELDS` in the first place.

### Usage

```foxpro
CLEAR FIELDS
```
### Example

```foxpro
USE OneTable
SET FIELDS TO First, Second
SELECT 0
USE Another
SET FIELDS TO Two, Night
CLEAR FIELDS
```
