## `EXP()`, `LOG()`, `LOG10()`

These functions are FoxPro's contribution to transcendental computing (which has nothing to do with transcendental meditation). `EXP()` stands for "e to the power," while `LOG()` and `LOG10()` compute logarithms for base e and base 10, respectively.

### Usage

```foxpro
nResultValue = EXP( nPower )
```

`EXP()` raises the constant e to the specified power, as in e<sup>nPower</sup>. You probably last saw this in college. Until now, so did we.

nPower can be any of the numeric types, but `EXP()` returns Numeric regardless.

### Example

```foxpro
?EXP(1)      && Returns 2.72 with default SET DECIMALS TO 2
SET DECIMALS TO 4
?EXP(1)      && Returns 2.7183
?EXP(-1)     && Returns 0.3679
?EXP(.5)     && Returns 1.6487
```
### Usage

```foxpro
nResultValue = LOG( nValue )
nResultValue = LOG10( nValue )
```

These two functions compute logarithms&mdash;no need for log tables or interpolation (another couple of things you probably haven't thought about since college). 

If you're like us, whenever you see something like y = log<sub>10</sub>x, you have to stop and say "Oh yeah, that means that 10 to the y is x" and then it makes sense again. On the other hand, if you're a normal human being, and not a math nerd like us, you'll probably swear that you never saw this stuff before in your life&mdash;it's okay, it's really not that bad! `LOG()` computes natural logarithms; that is, logs with a base of e. `LOG10()` computes logs with a base of 10. `LOG()` and `EXP()` are inverse functions, so LOG(EXP(nValue))=nValue.

As with `EXP()`, nValue can be any numeric type, but both functions return Numerics.

### Example

```foxpro
?LOG(1)     && Returns 0
?LOG(100)   && Returns 4.6052
?LOG10(1)   && Returns 0
?LOG10(100) && Returns 2 - hey, this makes sense!
```
