## `CLOSE TABLES`

This command closes open tables. Big surprise. Except that sometimes it closes free tables and sometimes it doesn't.

### Usage

```foxpro
CLOSE TABLES [ ALL ]
```

When a database is current, `CLOSE TABLES` closes all the open tables that belong to that database. With no current database, `CLOSE TABLES` closes all free tables. Add ALL to `CLOSE ALL` open tables, regardless of the current state of affairs or the origins of the tables. As with `CLOSE DATABASES`, work area 1 is selected.

From the point of view of this command (and pretty much everywhere else), views are considered tables in the database that owns them, while cursors created with SELECT or `CREATE CURSOR` are free tables.

In VFP 7, the BeforeCloseTable and AfterCloseTable events fire for tables that belong to a database with `Database Events` turned on.

### Example

```foxpro
OPEN DATA TasTrade
USE Customer IN 0
USE Employee IN 0
USE Orders IN 0

* Now one that's not in the database
USE FoxUser
* Now one from another database
USE TestData!Customer

SET DATABASE TO TasTrade
CLOSE TABLES      && Closes all tables from TasTrade.
CLOSE TABLES ALL  && Closes FoxUser and TestData!Customer.
                  && Both TasTrade and TestData are left open.
```
