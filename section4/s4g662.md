## `LIKEC()`

This one is the double-byte version of `LIKE()`. It appears to work properly with single-byte data, and we don't have double-byte data to test on. Like the other "C" functions, it was added in version 3.0b.

### Usage

```foxpro
lMatch = LIKEC( cWildcardString, cCompareString )
```
