## PrintJob ... EndPrintJob, _PBPage, _PCopies, _PECode, _PEject, _PEPage, _PSCode, _PWait

This command pair and the whole slew of associated system variables are remnants of a printer control system that first appeared in FoxPro 1. In that DOS-dominated, application-centric, dot-matrix, tractor-feed world, it was a clever way to avoid providing printer drivers but still give you control over output.

In a Windows world, most of this is totally irrelevant. Only one of these variables still does anything, and it doesn't do it very well. The table shows what these variables were originally intended to do. Except for _PCOPIES, they're all ignored in Visual FoxPro.

PRINTJOB ... ENDPRINTJOB is a wrapper that says everything inside is to be treated as one group. If _PCOPIES is greater than 1, PRINTJOB ... ENDPRINTJOB creates a de facto loop. 

Although _PCOPIES works, it's no better than simply wrapping your call to REPORT FORM in a FOR loop. It still generates the report multiple times and sends each to the printer independently.

We suggest you forget these are even in the language. Saying this makes us very unhappy, since _PBPage and _PEPage used to let us print only part of a report, but they don't do it in VFP. Starting in VFP 5, the RANGE clause of REPORT FORM is the solution to that one.

### Example

```foxpro
PRINTJOB
   _PCOPIES = 3
   REPORT FORM MyReport TO PRINT
ENDPRINTJOB
```
