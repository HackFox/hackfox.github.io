## Reset

The `Reset Method` of the Timer Control resets the Timer to start its countdown from the beginning. 

### Usage

```foxpro
tmrTimer.Reset()
```

A Timer is a built-in FoxPro control that counts down a specified interval of time (cleverly specified by its Interval property) and then performs the code included in the `Timer Event`. Reset causes it to start counting down again from the beginning. The Enabled property determines if the Timer is active. Setting the Interval property to zero also deactivates a Timer&mdash;the `Timer Event` will not fire, even though the Enabled property is .T.

### Example

```foxpro
TIMER1.Reset()
```
