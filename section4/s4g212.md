## ADir()

This function creates an array containing information about files in a specified directory. Read it as "Array from directory" and it makes perfect sense.

### Usage

```foxpro
nCount = ADIR( ArrayName [, cFileSpec [, cAttributes
               [, nFlag | cCreatorType ] ] ] )
```

The D, H and S attributes can be combined into a single attribute string. These interact with the file specification provided to select a subset of files and/or directories. To get a list of all sub-directories, pass the empty string for cFileSpec and "D" for cAttributes.

<table>
<tr>
  <td width="17%" valign="top">
<img width="95" height="78" src="bug.gif">
  </td>
  <td width="83%">
  <p>In VFP 5 and earlier, you could get a list of sub-directories for a specified directory by passing the path and a single asterisk for the file name, like this: </p>
<pre>ADIR(aSubDirs, cPath + &quot;*&quot;, &quot;D&quot;)</pre>
  <p>This approach doesn't work in VFP 6 and later&mdash;that call results in a list containing both files and directories. In those versions, you have to change to the directory of interest and then pass the empty string for the path, like this:</p>
<pre>CD (cPath)
ADIR(aSubDirs, &quot;&quot;, &quot;D&quot;)</pre>
  <p>Of course, in that case, you have to remember to save the old directory and change back to it afterward.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

If the volume name is requested, a single element character array is created, containing the volume name. In all other cases, the array created has five columns, as follows:

<table>
<tr>
  <td width="16%" valign="top">
  <p><b>Column</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width="84%" valign="top">
  <p><b>Meaning</b></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width="16%" valign="top">

  </td>
  <td width="84%" valign="top">
  <p>File name&mdash;character.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width="16%" valign="top">
  <p>2</p>
  </td>
  <td width="84%" valign="top">
  <p>File size in bytes&mdash;numeric.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width="16%" valign="top">
  <p>3</p>
  </td>
  <td width="84%" valign="top">
  <p>Date file was last written&mdash;date.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width="16%" valign="top">
  <p>4</p>
  </td>
  <td width="84%" valign="top">
  <p>Time file was last written&mdash;character.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width="16%" valign="top">
  <p>5</p>
  </td>
  <td width="84%" valign="top">
  <p>File Attributes&mdash;a single five-character string. Each position represents one attribute. If the file has that attribute, the corresponding letter is there; if not, a period is found in that location. The attributes are:<br> R&mdash;read-only<br> A&mdash;archive bit is set<br> S&mdash;system file<br> H&mdash;hidden file<br> D&mdash;directory</p>
  <p>For example, &quot;R....&quot; means a read-only file, while &quot;.A.H.&quot; means a hidden file needing to be archived.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
  <td width="17%" valign="top">
<img width="95" height="77" src="bug.gif">
  </td>
  <td width="83%">
  <p>In VFP 7, IntelliSense pops up a list of choices when you reach the attribute parameter. That's cool. What's not is that the list is wrong. It includes &quot;Archive&quot; and omits &quot;Volume.&quot; Choosing &quot;Archive&quot; generates a spurious cAttributes value of &quot;A.&quot; It turns out that you can pass pretty much anything for cAttributes without error, so it may be a while before you catch on that you're seeing all files, not just those in need of backup.</p>

We received a note from someone who read the first edition of this book and wondered what ADIR() returns if it can't create the array. We haven't quite figured out how to test that one. We think the only situation in which that could happen is if there are so many files in the directory that there's not enough memory to hold the resulting array or the array would exceed the limit of 65,000 elements. Seems to us that the directory structure would probably give out long before you could put enough files there to stress memory that way.

### Example

```foxpro
? ADIR(aFiles)            && Creates an array of all files in
                          && current directory.
? ADIR(aDirect, "", "D")  && Creates an array of all
                          && subdirectories of current directory.
? ADIR(aDBFs, "*.DBF", 1) && Fills array with list of tables
                          && in their original case.
? ADIR(aDBFs, "DATA\*.DBF", 2)&& Fills array with list of tables
                          && in DATA directory in DOS 8.3 format.
```
