## _Alignment, _Indent, _LMargin, _RMargin, _Tabs

These variables are vestiges of the printer control system introduced in FoxPro 1.0. Like so much in FoxPro, it seemed like a good idea at the time, but has been superseded several times since.

These variables control aspects of individual lines produced by ? and ??. Except for _TABS, they're only effective when _WRAP is .T.

### Usage

```foxpro
_ALIGNMENT = "LEFT" | "CENTER" | "RIGHT"
```

No, this variable doesn't determine the political affiliation of the end user. It indicates how text output with ? or ?? should be lined up. Best of all, it works as advertised.

### Usage

```foxpro
_INDENT = nCharsToIndent
```
<table>
<tr>
  <td width="17%" valign="top">
<img width="95" height="78" src="bug.gif">
  </td>
  <td width="83%">
  <p>This one, on the other hand, is flaky. It works, sort of, when applied to memo fields, but not the rest of the time. We say &quot;sort of&quot; because it moves all lines of the memo out to the specified indent, not just the first line. Consider it a &quot;block indent&quot; rather than a &quot;first line indent&quot; and it makes some sense. This, no doubt, ties in with FoxPro's &quot;automatic indent&quot; capability which is so handy when writing code, but it keeps happening even when automatic indent is turned off.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

### Usage

```foxpro
_LMARGIN = nLeftMargin
_RMARGIN = nRightMargin
```

These variables let you set left and right margins for the print area. Both are measured from the left edge, in character columns of the current output font.

### Usage

```foxpro
_TABS = cListOfTabStops
```

cListOfTabStops is a comma-delimited list of columns. Any CHR(9) in the text being output moves you to the next tab stop.

All in all, this is a nice set of pretty functional variables. It is remarkable that they work correctly with both proportional and non-proportional fonts. The only problem is they work with ? and ??. We don't use those much anymore, except to sound the bell, where margins and the like aren't particularly relevant.

### Example

```foxpro
_LMARGIN = 5
_RMARGIN = 75
_WRAP = .T.
_TABS = "15,25,35"
? "Look"+CHR(9)+"I can"+CHR(9)+"Make"+CHR(9)+"Columns"
? "This is the beginning of a long line that will eventually "+;
 "wrap, showing how the margins work. In fact, showing THAT "+;
 "the margins work."
```
