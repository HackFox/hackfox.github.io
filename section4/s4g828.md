## OLEDropTextInsertion

This property determines whether an object lets you insert text into the middle of words with OLE drag and drop, or only at the ends of words. 

### Usage

```foxpro
oObject.OLEDropTextInsertion = nInsertionType
nInsertionType = oObject.OLEDropTextInsertion
```

Of all the OLE drag and drop properties, this might be the easiest to understand. It determines, for a drop target, whether text dropped on that target gets inserted exactly where the pointer is positioned or only at the beginning of a word. When you set the property to 1, no matter where the pointer is placed, the dragged text goes at the beginning of that word. When it's 0 (the default), text goes right where you put it. We can see the need for each choice for different situations, and, in fact, could even see this one as user-configurable.

  </td>
  <td width="83%">
  <p>There's only one little problem. They broke it. In VFP 7, no matter which way this property is set, text gets dropped at the pointer position.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

The name of this property makes sense to us; so does its behavior. But somehow, we feel a slight mismatch between those two and the values it accepts. We're not sure exactly what we would use if it were up to us, though; .T. and .F. don't cut it, either. We do find the settings kind of backward. 0 feels like "off" to us, but putting dragged text anywhere seems like "on." We guess we'll get used to it eventually.

### Example

```foxpro
* Set this property based on the user's choice.
IF lPutTextAnywhere
   This.OLEDropTextInsertion = 0
ELSE
   This.OLEDropTextInsertion = 1
ENDIF
```
