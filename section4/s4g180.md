## `ACTIVATE SCREEN`

By default, output from many commands goes to the active window. `ACTIVATE SCREEN` lets you direct it to the main Visual FoxPro window instead.

### Usage

```foxpro
ACTIVATE SCREEN
```

When a user-defined window (including one containing a form) is active, issuing a command like `DISPLAY MEMORY` or ? sends the output to the window. That's not usually what you want. It sure isn't when we do it. Issue `ACTIVATE SCREEN` before the DISPLAY whatever or ?, and the output goes to the main window instead.

### Example

```foxpro
DEFINE WINDOW Test AT 0,0 SIZE 10,100
ACTIVATE WINDOW Test
* Now all output goes to window Test - prove it
DISPLAY MEMORY
* That's no good - try again
ACTIVATE SCREEN
DISPLAY MEMORY      && much better
RELEASE WINDOW Test && clean up
```
