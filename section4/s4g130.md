## Set Clock, Set("Clock")

This command controls both the location and visibility of the system clock. It allows you to turn the clock on and off and to position it either on the status bar or anywhere you want on the screen.

### Usage

```foxpro
SET CLOCK ON | OFF
SET CLOCK STATUS | TO [ nRow, nCol ]
```

Every version of SET CLOCK except SET CLOCK OFF turns the system clock on, in addition to anything else it does. You can also turn the clock on and off, though not control its location, in the View tab of the Options dialog.

With CLOCK set to STATUS, if you turn off the system status bar, the clock can't be seen.

The clock honors the current SET HOURS setting, but ignores SET SECONDS.

  <p>In the default location, the clock makes some assumptions about the size of the VFP window. It's happiest when the VFP window is maximized, and may not show up at all or may be cut off if the window isn't maximized. Tamar habitually works with all her applications sized to fill the screen vertically, but not horizontally (and shortcuts on the rightmost section of her desktop)&mdash;in her default setup, the clock gets cut off.</p>

### Example

```foxpro
SET CLOCK ON       && Make clock visible in last location
SET CLOCK STATUS   && Move the clock to the status bar
SET CLOCK OFF      && Turn the clock off
SET CLOCK ON       && Turn the clock on - in the status bar
SET CLOCK TO 0,0   && Move the clock to the upper left corner

* Have some fun with the clock
=rand(-1)
for nTimes=1 to 10
    SET CLOCK TO SROWS()*RAND(),SCOLS()*RAND()
    =INKEY(1)
endfor
```
### Usage

```foxpro
cClockStatus = SET( "CLOCK" )
cClockPosition = SET( "CLOCK", 1 )
```

Like most of the SET commands, the corresponding function returns the current settings. SET("CLOCK") returns "ON", "OFF" or "STATUS", while passing a second parameter returns the position of the clock. While the syntax diagram shows a second parameter of 1, in fact, any number or string will do. The position is returned as a comma-separated string. If you haven't specified a position, the empty string is returned.

### Example

```foxpro
SET CLOCK ON
? SET("CLOCK")    && Displays ON
? SET("CLOCK",1)  && Displays the empty string
SET CLOCK TO 0,0
? SET("CLOCK",1)  && Displays 0.000,   0.000
```
