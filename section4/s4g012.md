## `ISALPHA()`, `ISDIGIT()`, `ISLOWER()`, `ISUPPER()`

These functions all tell you about the state of a character. `ISALPHA()` returns .T. if the character is alphabetic while `ISDIGIT()` returns .T. if it's a numeric digit. `ISLOWER()` and `ISUPPER()` check the case of a character and return .F. if it's the wrong case or not alphabetic.

### Usage

```foxpro
lIsItAlphabetic = ISALPHA( cString )
lIsItADigit = ISDIGIT( cString )
lIsItLower = ISLOWER( cString )
lIsItUpper = ISUPPER( cString )
```

Although you can pass an entire character string to these functions, they only look at the first character, so:

```foxpro
?ISDIGIT("1abc")
```
returns .T., as does:

```foxpro
?ISUPPER("Smith")
```
Use these functions in parsing and in validating user input. For example, you might check all the characters of a supposedly numeric string before applying `VAL()` to it. However, if you need all uppercase or all lowercase letters for an operation, it's easier to just apply `UPPER()` or `LOWER()`.

Note that Windows and its ANSI font standard has a different interpretation of which characters constitute the alphabet from DOS and its ASCII basis. `ISALPHA()` is true for many of the high-order characters (like ƒ, Š, and Ñ), which Windows/ANSI maps to non-English alphabets, while FoxPro/DOS reported .F. for anything other than A through Z, uppercase and lowercase.

### Example

```foxpro
? ISALPHA("\WINWORD")   && returns .F.
? ISDIGIT("Age 7")      && returns .F.
? ISLOWER("lower case") && returns .T.
? ISUPPER("\WINWORD")   && returns .F.
```
