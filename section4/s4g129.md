## `SET CLEAR`

This is an obscure command related to an obsolete capability. It determines whether or not the main window is cleared when you use a format file.

### Usage

```foxpro
SET CLEAR ON | OFF
```

Format files were perhaps the first attempt at making it easy to provide attractive input screens. A format file contains a bunch of SAYs and GETs, which are used as a template for the EDIT command (and some other related commands). You establish the format file with `SET FORMAT`, then when you issue EDIT or APPEND, the input fields conform to the definitions in the format file.

`SET CLEAR` ON indicates that the main window should be cleared when you use the format file. 

`SET CLEAR` OFF leaves the main window alone.

We can't see any reason to use this command. Format files are several generations obsolete.
