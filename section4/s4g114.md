## `GETENV()`

This function returns the value of a DOS environment variable.

### Usage

```foxpro
cValue = GETENV( cVarName )
```

Use `GETENV()` to find information like the DOS path, the directory in which Windows is installed, and so forth. On a network, there are likely to be variables containing information about the network configuration.

You can also create environment variables for your own purposes in AUTOEXEC.BAT and query them with `GETENV()`. You might set up your development machine with a variable, DEVMODE, set to "YES" and use that value to trigger certain behavior in your apps (debugging behaviors, for example).

When the variable you specify doesn't exist, `GETENV()` returns the empty string. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. It's good because it makes schemes like the one above work&mdash;your users don't have to have a DEVMODE variable. It's bad because it makes it easy to make typos. The moral of the story is that you need to double-check `GETENV()` calls&mdash;in fact, test them in the command window first.

### Example

```foxpro
cCurDOSPath = GETENV("Path")
```
