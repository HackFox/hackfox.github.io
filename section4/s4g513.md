## LineSlant

This property determines if the Line control slants from the upper-left to the lower-right corners, or from the lower-left to the upper-right corners of the rectangle described by the Line's Height, Width, Top and Left properties.

### Usage

```foxpro
linLine.LineSlant = cWhichWay
cWhichWay = linLine.LineSlant
```

You have two choices for the cWhichWay property&mdash;the slash "/" and the backslash "\\". But, you say, what if you want a vertical line&mdash;can't you supply a bar or pipe character "\|" or, for a horizontal line, a hyphen, dash or underscore? Nope. Any other character other than the two slashes is either ignored or generates an error.

To create a vertical or horizontal line, change the Height or Width property to zero and then adjust the other settings to place the line where you'd like it.

### Example

```foxpro
linLine1.LineSlant = "/"
```
