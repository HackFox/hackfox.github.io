## `SHOW GETS`, Sys(2016)

`SHOW GETS` refreshes the display of all the controls in a READ-style screen, as well as executing the READ's SHOW clause. This was the key mechanism for updating the display in FoxPro 2.x. SYS(2016) returns the name of the last window named in a `SHOW GETS` command&mdash;we never found a use for this function in 2.x (though GENSCRN, the screen-generation program, generated code that used it.) 

Of course, in Visual FoxPro, `SHOW GETS` is obsolete. Use the form's Refresh method instead. Initiating the Refresh method of a form or container also fires the Refresh methods of any contained controls. `SHOW GETS` also lets you enable or disable entire screens or change their colors. You can simply manipulate a form's properties to do these.
